                <h5 class="text-left subtle">Secretary</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">I have vast experience of many administrative roles dating back to the late 1980's including secretary of Coxford and Millbrook Labour Party wards.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I have successfully run my own childminding business for the last 7 years and have held many roles within PACEY which is an organisation representing Early Years practitioners, including Facilitator for Southampton and National Policy Forum Rep. I am currently a School governor of a Southampton Primary School.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I am also a member of Unite Community and was the founding member of Momentum in Southampton after helping in the first election of Jeremy Corbyn as Leader and bringing Jeremy to our City for a massive rally in 2015. I have helped Momentum Southampton to grow and brought new members to the Labour Party locally and encouraged others to rejoin and become active.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I believe that the success of any organisation lies partly with the actions of its secretary and with the skills and experience that I have gained over the years through my paid and voluntary work I know that I have the qualities that a good secretary should possess. I am methodical, well organised, reliable, honest and have good I.T. Skills to name but a few.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I fully support the leadership of our Party and its Socialist policies including a secure publicly-provided NHS, National Education Service, mass social/council house building, protecting our planet and public ownership of our railways.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I will work closely with the other members of the E.C. to make sure that Southampton and Romsey Labour Party is inclusive, democratic and continues to grow. I look forward to your support.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">I am a Trade Union (USDAW) rep in a local supermarket, which places me at the heart of the lowest paid vulnerable working class community which the Labour Party was formed to empower.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Through my Trade Union activities I have developed skills in organising, I.T., administration, note-taking and various presentation and meeting skills.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I am currently on USDAW's prestigious Organising Academy, a model on which the TUC has based its own Academy. This has allowed me to take my organisational skills to the next level.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I would be absolutely delighted to take on a role in a Labour Party committed to the Socialist policies of our leadership, policies which will seek to eradicate many inequalities in our society.

                <h5 class="text-left subtle">Political Education Officer</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">I have been a member of the Labour Party and lifelong trade union activist since 1970/80's. I have been active as a trade unionist first in the Building Trade and then in the Post Office for a number of years. I have held many positions in both the Labour Party and Trade unions such as Chair of a CLP, Branch Secretary of the CWU, President of a Trades Council as well as being a shop steward for many years. I have a practiced based history that has involved working with Black South African Trade Unions internationally. I believe fundamentally in equality/diversity and the political need to ensure our Party is reflective of this diversity and is inclusive to all sections of society.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I have been involved in political education since the 80's and worked with striking miners during the miners strike of 84/85 in this capacity. In the 80's I went on to study for a degree and a teaching qualification and started formally teaching shop stewards and fulltime trade union officials. I have also worked for the Open University as a tutor in the 90's teaching Social Science. I have a theoretical and practice based history in political education and have been teaching politics for over 30 years.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I am experienced, passionate and knowledgeable about political education and see this is as one of the most important issues/areas for our Party. I believe that in moving forward the Party must recognise the importance of political education and I believe with others I can play a role in helping to achieve this.</p>

                <h4 class="text-left">Gemma Griffiths</h4>
                <h5 class="text-left subtle">Women's Officer</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">My name is Gemma Griffiths, I live in the Southampton Test constituency. I would very much like to be your nominee for Womens' Officer. Here's a little bit about myself and why I am asking for your nomination.</p></p>
                <p class="text-justify">I am a 37 year old teacher. I have been active within the NASUWT and have represented members in several workplaces as a NASUWT union representative. I have spent my life as a teacher teaching children and adults, including working extensively in the community with troubled families to support parents and their children to increase life chances and opportunities.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I strongly believe in the values of our party. I am inspired and highly motivated by Jeremy being elected again and the direction that our party is now moving in.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Our party has a great history of developing women and working towards equality. Ever since its formation our party has been the natural home for generations of women campaigning for social justice and equality. From the work of Margaret Bondfield, Ellen Wilkinson, Jenny Lee and Barbara Castle who paved the way towards where we are today, to women such as Diane Abbott and Angela Rayner who prove that women can be strong in key roles in the shadow cabinet, our party can be a great example to women and men alike. However, though these are good, solid foundations, we have a long way to go to achieve equality.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">If I was to be elected to this position, I would like to work with our members and out in the community to engage women in a very practical way. This would develop skills, knowledge and confidence to enable women to play a full and active role. It would be my intention to work with others in the party collaboratively in order to build an inclusive party that represents all women and reflects diversity both within the party and our affiliates. Thank you for your time.</p>

                <h5 class="text-left subtle">Press/Public Relations Officer</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">I am standing for the position of press officer as an active member of the Southampton and Romsey Labour party and a press officer by trade for the National Oceanography Centre. In this role it is my responsibility to translate complex science into engaging and targeted messages for a range of audiences, as well as pitching stories to regional and national media. For example, this week I have been working on the Boaty McBoatface campaign as a means of getting the important science we do to a new audience. This experience will help me form engaging messages and get them out to as many Southampton residents as possible using a range of channels.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I hope to draw on the skills and enthusiasm of the membership to drive a successful media campaign. For example, I hope to have a small group of people working on our social media channels to ensure we have regular and highly visual content that helps promote our councillors as well as getting our messages out. I would also like to co-ordinate the use of the letters and readers blog pages of the Daily Echo as well as radio phone in’s to reach an audience that did not vote Labour at the last election.</p>

                <h5 class="text-left subtle">Local Government Officer</h5>
                <p class="text-justify">I have been a member of the Labour party since 1982, a trade unionist and socialist all my adult life. I have also been U.S.D.A.W. Branch secretary for 20 years as well as Senior Shop Steward and I stood as a Labour Party Council candidate in the past and hope to again in the future.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I am re-invigorated by the election of Jeremy Corbyn and support the policies being put forward, particularly a fully funded public NHS, a mass Social/Council house building program and public ownership of Railways, and a municipal Bus service.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">I feel that councillors/candidates should be representative of the wider membership of our Party and by involving more ward members in the selection process will be very important for our internal democracy.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">It is paramount that all existing councillors and any new candidates are treated fairly during the selection process. My experience of dealing with many issues with my trade union including National Wage negotiations will stand me in good stead for this role. I look forward to your support.</p>
